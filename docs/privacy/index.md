# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 18, 2024**

DMFlow ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the DMFlow mobile application.

## Information We Collect

- Follow-up dates and reminders
- Pipeline stage information

### Automatically Collected Information
- App usage analytics (feature usage counts for subscription limits)

## How Your Data is Stored

**All prospect data is stored locally on your device.** DMFlow does not upload your prospect information to our servers. Your data remains on your iPhone or iPad unless you explicitly choose to export it.

## AI-Powered Features

DMFlow Pro includes AI-powered message suggestions. When you use this feature:

- Your prospect's name, stage, and notes are sent to OpenAI's API to generate personalized message suggestions
- This data is transmitted securely via HTTPS

- OpenAI does not use API data to train their models
- We do not store your AI requests or responses on our servers

**You can use DMFlow without the AI features.** The AI message suggestion feature is optional and only activated when you explicitly request suggestions.

## Subscriptions and Payments

DMFlow Pro subscriptions are processed through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information. All billing is handled by Apple according to their [Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties, except:

- **OpenAI**: When you use AI message suggestions (as described above)
- **Apple**: For App Store purchases and subscriptions
- **Legal Requirements**: If required by law or to protect our rights

## Data Export and Deletion

You have full control over your data:

- **Export**: You can export all your data as a JSON file from Settings > Export Data
- **Delete**: You can delete individual prospects or all data by uninstalling the app

## Children's Privacy

DMFlow is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## Security

We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data:
- All data is stored locally on your device
- AI feature communications use HTTPS encryption
- No server-side storage of your prospect data
